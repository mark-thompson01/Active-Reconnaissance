# Active-Reconnaissance Lab

This lab outlines performing host discovery, port scanning, service version detection, and vulnerability scanning and detection using Nmap. The lab was conducted in a controlled environment to demonstrate various reconnaissance techniques.

## What I've Learned
Through this project, I have learned:
- How to perform host discovery on a given network
- How to perform port scanning on given network host(s)
- How to perform host fingerprinting
- How to retrive information on the protocols and services in use
